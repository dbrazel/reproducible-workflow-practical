This repo contains the practical for the reproducible workflows section of SICSS Oxford, 2021. It is a deliberately poorly-done analysis of publicly-available University of Michigan salary data. Students will be asked to clone this repository and fix it using the practices discussed in the lecture and their own expertise.

The columns of the data are:

- campus
  - campus within the Michigan system
- title
  - Job title
- dept
  - Department
- annual_ftr
  - Annualised full-time rate, the salary that an employee would have been paid had they worked full-time for the full year
- ftr_basis
  - The length of time that constitutes a full year for an employee, i.e. professors often don't work in the summer (or are paid from a grant if they do)
- frac_fte
  - Proportion of full-time work done by an employee, one day a week = 0.2
- amt_from_gen_fund
  - Fraction of salary paid from the university's general fund
